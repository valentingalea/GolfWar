The game is codenamed "GolfWar" and it's essentialy golf but instead of striking the ball with clubs, instead you fire giant ball-like projectiles from cannons. For the final putting phase a smaller mortar is used. The scale of the course is bigger than in real life and it requires traversal with a vehicle. This in turn is part of the gameplay, as the player needs to find and navigate to the next strike location.

The game is an FPS and has realistic handling of preparing and firing the canon, navigating the course with a map and binoculars and driving a buggy that carries the cannons.

Phases of gameplay in detail:
1. The player has an inventory and can cycle thru various items that are held in hand FPS style: empty hand for interacting, map that can be looked up close, binoculars that can be equiped, etc.
2. The player has a buggy/jeep that he can get in and out of, and drive around. The jeep drags along via an attachment the canon.
3. The cannon is the equivalent of a modern Howitzer and can be rotated left/right and up/down, loaded with projectiles, then fired upon.
4. At the begining (and at each new ball position) the player must prepare a new projectile, insert in the canon, adjust rotation and height, then fire via pulling a cable.
5. The projectile or shell can be customized in various ways: adjusting weight via adding more or less balast, and choosing different steering fins.
6. The basic game loop consists of:
	A: the player chooses and customizes a shell.
	B. the shell is inserted in the cannon - the player is holding it physically like an item and must insert it in the cannon
	C. the player adjusts the cannon via interacting with controls on its sides
	D. the player fires the cannon
	E. the player can observe the trajectory of the shell with the binoculars (a visible path is drawn when the binoculars are used, otherwise the path is not drawn)
	F. the player gets in the buggy and must drive and navigate the terrain and reach where the shell landed
	G. a simpler variant of this loop happens during the putting phase where a mortar is used so everything (cannon, shells) are smaller.

The primary version is singleplayer but later it can be expanded for co-op play where 2 players can help each other is firing and navigating.
